They are doing their part. But can local communities do more? Should we be doing more at the state level? And are there any steps that the federal government can take to make sure that dangerous driving stops taking so many lives? In your essay, try your best to tackle these important driver safety issues.\r\n\r\nMake sure your essay is original work.",
