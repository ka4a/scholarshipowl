            <p>Without limiting the foregoing, the permission granted to Customer to access and use the Services is based on Customer&rsquo;s agreement to not access or use the Services for: (i) developing a product or service that could reasonably be regarded as being competitive with the Services, or (ii) monitoring the availability, performance or functionality of the Services, or for any other benchmarking or competitive purpose. </p>
            <p><strong>Customer shall not, and shall not permit third parties to, block, mask or obscure advertisements that appear on the Website.</strong> </p>

Customer agrees to reject any scholarship provider to which Customer or anyone on Customer&rsquo;s behalf has applied in the past.

            <p><strong>1.3</strong> <u>Additional Services</u>. Owl may from time to time offer additional services (&ldquo;<strong>Additional Services</strong>&rdquo;).

Customer is solely responsible for Customer&rsquo;s Account, including for: (i) controlling the access to, and use and security of, the Account and Customer&rsquo;s Content (as defined below), (ii) maintaining the security of the passwords and other measures used to protect access to the Account, and (iii) all instructions provided to Owl through the Account, whether or not authorized by Customer.

            <p><strong>1.6</strong> <u>Third Party Services</u>. Certain components of the Services may be comprised of third party services (&ldquo;<strong>Third Party Services</strong>&rdquo;), and Owl may perform its obligations hereunder through the third party providers of such Third Party Services (&ldquo;<strong>Third Party Service Providers</strong>&rdquo;).

            <h2 class="h4"><p><strong>2. Fees &amp; </strong><strong>Billing.</strong></p></h2>
            <p><strong>2.1</strong> <u>Fees</u>. </p>
            <p>In consideration for Customer&rsquo;s usage of the Services, Customer agrees to pay Owl fees at Owl&rsquo;s then-current pricing for the Services as published from time to time on the Website. All payments from Customer to Owl must be in United States Dollars.</p>
            <p>Owl may in its sole discretion modify its pricing upon the provision of at least 30 days&rsquo; notice to already-paying customers, by posting a notice on the Website and sending an email to the address maintained for the relevant Account.</p> <p>Unless Customer notifies Owl in writing of Customer&rsquo;s termination of its use of the Services within 14 days after delivery of such notice, the Customer will be deemed to have consented to the updated pricing.</p>
            <p><strong>2.2</strong> <u>Billing.</u></p>
            <p>Owl will bill Customerâ€™s credit card / debit card / PayPal account for the Services ordered by Customer, either as a one-time payment, or in automatically reoccurring payments if Customer has an ongoing subscription. Owl shall send a sales receipt to Customer upon request.</p>
            <p> Customers with ongoing subscriptions are responsible for maintaining current and complete credit card / debit card / PayPal account information on file with Owlâ€™s payment processor at all times. Owl uses Braintree (a PayPal service) as its payment processor. Customersâ€™ payment account information, including credit/debit card number or PayPal account information, are stored by Braintree and may be used for future or reoccurring payments (if the Customer has an ongoing subscription with reoccurring payments). Changes to on-file payment account information, or requests to delete payment account information on file, must be communicated to Owl at <a href="mailto:scholarships@scholarshipowl.com">scholarships@scholarshipowl.com</a>. Owl may change its payment processor at any time with or without notice to Customer. </p>
            <p> All charges are automatically made on Customerâ€™s specific billing cycle date as disclosed during the enrollment process. If Customerâ€™s Services begin with a free trial period, Customer must cancel the Services prior to the end of the free trial period in order to avoid being charged. </p>
            <p>Owl shall have the right to suspend Customerâ€™s Account without prior notice once payment is overdue by 10 calendar days.</p>
            <p> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CUSTOMER WAIVES ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICES UNLESS CLAIMED WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER THE CHARGE.</p>
            <p><strong>2.3</strong> <u>Cancellation</u>. Subject to the requirements of Section 3 below, Customer may cancel their Services by (i) submitting a cancellation request through their Account on the Website; (ii) sending an email to <a href="mailto:scholarships@scholarshipowl.com">scholarships@scholarshipowl.com</a> specifying the email address used for the account and clearly indicating that they want to cancel or (iiI) calling customer service at 800 494 4908 Monday - Friday, 11a.m. to 6p.m. EST and 8a.m. to 3p.m. PST.</p>
            <p><strong>2.4</strong> <u>Refunds</u>. Except as specifically identified in this Section 2.3, all payments to Owl are non-refundable.  If Customer purchased a Service that began with a free trial period and does not cancel prior to the end of the free trial period, (i) the first fee paid following the free trial period is non-refundable and (ii) subsequent fees are non-refundable except that Owl will refund upon request the fee paid for the most recent billing cycle so long as Customer has not logged into or otherwise accessed or used the Service during the applicable billing cycle.  If Customer purchased a Service that did not begin with a free trial period, fees are non-refundable except that Owl will refund upon request the fee paid for the most recent billing cycle so long as Customer has not logged into or otherwise accessed or used the Service during the applicable billing cycle.  To request a refund, Customer must submit their request using Owlâ€™s contact form, sending an email to refunds@scholarshipowl.com, or calling 1-800-494-4908.</p>
            <p><strong>2.5</strong> <u>Late Fees</u>. Owl may charge interest on overdue amounts at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, plus all reasonable expenses and costs of collection (including collection agency fees, attorney fees and court costs). The assessment of interest shall not limit Owl&rsquo;s other rights and remedies for late payment, including Owl&rsquo;s right to suspend or terminate access to the Services. </p>
            <p><strong>2.6</strong> <u>Taxes</u>. Customer is responsible for all taxes, fees and duties, including penalties and interest, imposed in connection with these Terms of Use and the Services (<strong>&ldquo;Taxes&rdquo;</strong>). Customer will pay Owl its fees without reduction for Taxes. If Owl is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to Customer, unless Customer provides Owl on a timely basis with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority (along with any supporting documentation that Owl may require in connection with such tax exemption certificate). If any deduction or withholding is required by law, Customer will notify Owl and pay Owl any additional amounts necessary to ensure that the net amount that Owl receives, after any deduction and withholding, equals the amount Owl would have received if no deduction or withholding has been required. Customer shall provide to Owl original or certified copies of all Tax payments or other evidence of payment of Taxes by Customer with respect to transactions or payments under these Terms of Use. </p>
            <p><strong>2.7</strong> <u>Third Party Fees</u>. Any third party fees (including credit card, debit card, PayPal and bank fees) (&ldquo;<strong>Third Party Fees</strong>&rdquo;) are Customer&rsquo;s sole responsibility, and if charged to Owl, Customer shall pay Owl an additional amount equaling the Third Party Fees in order to ensure that the net amount that Owl receives equals the amount Owl would have received if no Third Party Fees had been charged. </p>
            <h2 class="h4"><p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Term and Termination.</strong></p></h2>
            <p><strong>3.1</strong> <u>Term</u>. These Terms of Use will commence on the Effective Date and will remain in effect until terminated by either party in accordance with the terms hereof. Customer is encouraged to keep records of all communications regarding termination.</p>
            <p><strong>3.2</strong> <u>Termination for Convenience</u>. Each party may terminate these Terms of Use and Customer&rsquo;s right to access and use the Services by providing the other party with 7 business days prior notice. </p>
            <p>Customer&rsquo;s mere cancelation of its credit card / debit card / PayPal account associated with its Account does not terminate these Terms of Use or Customer&rsquo;s obligation to pay for the Services. In such case, Owl will continue to the Account as active and the billing cycle will continue, resulting in a past due account that may be turned over to a third party collection service.</p>
            <p><strong>3.3</strong> <u>Termination for Breach and Other Reasons</u>. Owl may terminate these Terms of Use and Customer&rsquo;s right to access and use the Services immediately and without liability upon providing notice to Customer as follows: (i) if Owl suspects a breach of these Terms of Use or violation of applicable law, (ii) if Owl is threatened with a legal claim, including for intellectual property infringement, related to the Services, (iii) if Customer&rsquo;s act or omission results in a suspension described in Section 1.8, (iv) if Owl&rsquo;s relationship with a Third Party Services Provider expires, terminates or requires Owl to change the Services or terminate these Terms of Use, (v) if Owl believes providing the Services could create an economic or technical burden or security risk, (vi) in order to comply with applicable law or requests of governmental entities, or (vii) if Owl determines that the use of the Services by Customer or Owl&rsquo;s provision of any of the Services has become impractical or unfeasible for any legal or regulatory reason. </p>
            <p><strong>3.4</strong> <u>Effect of Termination</u>. If these Terms of Use is terminated, then: (i) Owl shall immediately terminate Customer&rsquo;s access to the Services, including removing Customer from any scholarship sweepstakes in which Customer is enrolled as of the date of termination, (ii) all fees and Taxes that Customer is obliged to pay Owl, up to the effective date of termination, will be charged at the end of the then-current billing period, (iii) there will be no refund of any amount already paid by Customer as of the effective date of termination, including any amount in respect of the period following the effective date of termination, and (iv) Owl shall maintain Customer&rsquo;s Content. </p>
            <h2 class="h4"><p><strong>4. </strong><strong>Acceptable Use.</strong></p></h2>
            <p><strong>4.1</strong> Customer shall use the Services in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, shall not violate or attempt to violate Owl&rsquo;s system or network security, and shall not misuse the Services in any way. Customer shall not (i) engage in, solicit, or promote any activity that is illegal, invasive, violates the rights of others, or could subject Owl to liability to third parties, (ii) submit Customer&rsquo;s Content that is defamatory, misleading, fraudulent, obscene, distasteful, harassing, discriminatory, racially or ethnically offensive, contains sexually suggestive or explicit content, facilitates or promotes illegal activity, or contains illegal content, (iii) distribute viruses, worms, Trojan horses, corrupted files, hoaxes, or other items of a disabling, destructive, damaging, or deceptive nature, or (iii) disable, interfere with, or circumvent any aspect of the Services. </p>
            <p><strong>4.2</strong> Owl may, but is not obligated to, monitor Customer&rsquo;s Content, and it is Customer&rsquo;s sole responsibility to monitor the content uploaded by Customer or on Customer's behalf, pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4. In the event there is concern regarding any violation of these Terms of Use by Customer, Owl is authorized, in its sole discretion, to monitor Customer&rsquo;s compliance, to immediately terminate or suspend the provision of Services to Customer, or to block the transmission of Customer&rsquo;s Content which in Owl&rsquo;s opinion violates these Terms of Use, any applicable law or otherwise may impose any liability on Owl. </p>
            <h2 class="h4"><p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Publicity.</strong></p></h2>
            <p>Customer hereby irrevocably and in perpetuity grants to Owl, those acting under Owl&rsquo;s authority, and any third party sponsor or co-sponsor of a scholarship (&ldquo;<strong>Scholarship Partner</strong>&rdquo;) the unrestricted, absolute, perpetual, worldwide right and license to use Customer&rsquo;s name, address, photograph, likeness, voice, biographical and personal information, statements, Scholarship Sweepstakes application, essays, and any photograph, film, video, audio recording or other recording taken of Customer or such materials (collectively, &ldquo;<strong>Promotional</strong> <strong>Content</strong>&rdquo;), and all in connection with marketing purposes; and to reproduce, copy, modify, create derivative works of, display, perform, exhibit, distribute, transmit or broadcast, publicly or otherwise, or otherwise use and permit to be used, the Promotional Content or any part thereof, whether alone or in combination with other materials (including but not limited to text, data, images, photographs, illustrations, and graphics, video or audio segments of any nature), in any media whatsoever, in connection with such marketing purposes; and all the foregoing without any compensation, royalties, remuneration or consideration to Customer or to any third party, and Customer hereby waives all claims to compensation, royalties, remuneration, consideration, notice or permission in connection therewith. </p>

            <p>Customer represents and warrants to Owl that (i) Customer&rsquo;s Content is complete and accurate (besides being a breach of the terms of these Terms of Use, should Customer&rsquo;s Content not be complete and accurate, any application that Owl may submit on Customer&rsquo;s behalf may be unsuccessful or discarded, and incorrect Customer&rsquo;s Content may not be able to be later corrected), (ii) Customer has the requisite power and authority to enter into these Terms of Use and into any Additional Agreement, and to perform all of Customer&rsquo;s obligations hereunder, (iii) Customer is a natural person over the age of 13, and (iv) Customer is not named on any U.S. Government denied party list. Customer shall update Customer&rsquo;s Account information to maintain the accuracy of Customer&rsquo;s Content during the term of these Terms of Use. </p>
            <h2 class="h4"><p><strong>7. </strong><strong>Indemnification.</strong></p></h2>
            <p>Customer will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Owl, its affiliates and licensors, and each of their respective employees, officers, directors, agents and representatives, from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, fines and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) arising out of or relating to: (i) Customer&rsquo;s actual or alleged use of the Services (including any activities under Customer&rsquo;s Account), (ii) breach of these Terms of Use, any Additional Agreement, any representation or warranty of Customer (including breach of any terms of use or agreement with any provider of Separate Services) or any violation of applicable law, or (iii) Customer&rsquo;s Content, including any claim involving alleged infringement or misappropriation of third-party rights by or in connection with Customer&rsquo;s Content. </p>
            <p>Owl shall promptly notify Customer of any claim subject to indemnification, provided that Owl&rsquo;s failure to do so shall not affect Customer&rsquo;s obligations hereunder, except to the extent that Owl&rsquo;s failure to promptly notify Customer materially delays or prejudices Customer&rsquo;s ability to defend the claim. At Owl&rsquo;s option, Customer will have the right to defend against any such claim with counsel of Customer&rsquo;s own choosing (subject to Owl&rsquo;s written consent) and to settle such claim as Customer deems appropriate, provided that Customer shall not enter into any settlement without Owl&rsquo;s prior written consent and provided that Owl may, at any time, elect to take over control of the defense and settlement of the claim. </p>
            <h2 class="h4"><p><strong>8. </strong><strong>Disclaimers of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</strong></p></h2>
