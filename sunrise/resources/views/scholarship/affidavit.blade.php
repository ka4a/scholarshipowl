        not limited to, any and all claims of defamation, privacy, or publicity, arising out of any use or
        uses of my name or Works as contemplated herein. I will not hold {{ $business['companyName'] }}, its
        Licensees, or anyone who receives permission from {{ $business['companyName'] }}, responsible for
        any liability resulting from the use of my name or Works in accordance with the terms hereof.
