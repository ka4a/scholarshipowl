    Prizes will be awarded only if the potential prize winner fully complies with these Official Rules.
    All prize details are at the sole discretion of Sponsor and any depiction of the prizes, in Sweepstakes
    materials or otherwise, is for illustrative purposes only. Prizes are non-transferable,
    non-exchangeable, and non-refundable, and must be accepted by the winner as awarded. A prize
    winner may waive his/her right to receive a prize. Sponsor shall have no responsibility or
    obligation to a prize winner or a potential prize winner who is unable or unavailable to, or
    who does not for any reason, accept or utilize a prize. In the event of non-compliance with

    that prize will be forfeited. A forfeited prize may be awarded to an alternate winner,
    in Sponsor's sole discretion.

    Any required tax reporting forms will be furnished to the appropriate authorities.
</p>

<h2>6. WINNER NOTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION</h2>
<p>
    Sponsor will select a potential winner at random from all eligible Sweepstakes
    participants on <span class="ql-dynamic-tag">[scholarship_deadline]</span> (“Draw Date”). Sponsor will attempt
    to notify a potential winner using the email address and telephone number
    associated with their Sweepstakes submission within three (3) business days of the
    Draw Date. If a potential winner cannot be contacted or does not respond to
    Sponsor within seventy-two (72) hours of Sponsor’s initial notification, the
    potential winner may be disqualified at Sponsor’s sole discretion.
</p>
<p>
    A potential winner must provide Sponsor the information required to file any
    necessary tax reporting forms, including but not limited to their Social Security
    number or tax ID for tax reporting purposes if Sponsor is required to file an
    IRS Form 1099 with the Internal Revenue Service for the value of a prize awarded
    and accepted. Except where prohibited by law, a potential winner also may be
    required to sign and return to Sponsor, within seventy-two (72) hours of Sponsor’s
    initial notification, a Winner’s Affidavit and Publicity Release (“Affidavit”) via
    email to the address specified by Sponsor in order to claim his or her prize.
    If the potential winner is under the age of 18, the Affidavit must be co-signed by
    a parent or legal guardian. If the Affidavit is returned as undeliverable or
    incomplete or a potential winner fails to complete, sign and return the applicable
    Affidavit within the required time period, or the potential winner does not adhere
    to the Official Rules, including without limitation, the potential winner does not
    fulfill the eligibility requirements, the potential winner may be disqualified at
    Sponsor’s sole discretion.
</p>
<p>
    In the event a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, or if a prize is
    unclaimed or not accepted, the prize will be forfeited. If forfeited for any reason,
    the potential winner will not receive any other prize substitution or compensation,
    and the prize will remain the property of Sponsor and will not be awarded, except as
    provided herein. Sponsor, at its sole discretion, may award the forfeited prize to
    an alternate potential winner. If the Sponsor decides to select an alternate
    potential winner for the prize, the alternate will be selected at random from all
    eligible Sweepstakes participants and will be required to adhere to the timeframes
    and obligations of potential winners as stated in the previous paragraphs of this
    section 6. Sponsor retains the right to repeat this process until an alternate
    potential winner complies with these Official Rules.
</p>
<p>
    ALL POTENTIAL WINNERS ARE SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY SPONSOR. SPONSOR’S DECISIONS
    AS TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND OPERATION OF THE SWEEPSTAKES, ANY CHANGES TO THESE
    OFFICIAL RULES, AND THE SELECTION OF POTENTIAL WINNERS IS FINAL AND BINDING IN ALL
    MATTERS RELATED TO THE SWEEPSTAKES.
</p>

    the prize are 1:10,000.

    or illegal, the other provisions will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance
    with their terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein.
    Sponsor's failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules will not constitute a waiver
    of that provision. Headings are solely for convenience of reference and will not be deemed
    to affect in any manner the meaning or intent of the Official Rules or any provision hereof.
</p>
